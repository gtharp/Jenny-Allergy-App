# Jenny Allergy App

Daily pollen & allergen alerts for Jenny in San Antonio, TX — delivered straight to her phone.

> **Goal:** Every morning (≈ 6 AM CDT) Jenny receives a concise SMS telling her whether cedar, ragweed, or mold spores are going to ruin the day.

**Live demo:** https://gtharp.github.io/Jenny-Allergy-App/  
*(auto-published from `main` via GitHub Pages)*

## What’s new (v 0.3 — 2025-07-11)

- **GitHub Pages enabled** – `_config.yml` now configures a minimal Jekyll theme, so pushes to `main` publish automatically. ([GitHub](https://github.com/gtharp/Jenny-Allergy-App))
- **Timestamp injection** – `index.html` adds a JS hook that prints the exact build time, so Jenny knows when the data was generated. ([GitHub](https://github.com/gtharp/Jenny-Allergy-App))
- **Style refresh** – `styles.css` cleaned up: renamed CSS variables, better mobile spacing, and dark-mode-friendly contrast tweaks. ([GitHub](https://github.com/gtharp/Jenny-Allergy-App))
